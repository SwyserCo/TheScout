  - mmWave (LD2402) for accurate presence detection
  - BME280 for temperature, humidity, and pressure
  - VEML7700 for precise light level monitoring
  - MEMS microphone for sound detection
  - Built-in tamper detection
- **Power**: USB-powered with 1800mAh battery backup (~34.6h idle, ~4.4h peak)
- **Microcontroller**: ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 with Wi-Fi connectivity
- **Interfaces**: RGB LED, Status LED, Buzzer, Reset Button

### Software

  - WiFi with fallback configuration portal
  - MQTT communication
  - OTA updates support
- **Monitoring**:
  - Real-time environmental data
  - Motion detection with distance measurement
  - Sound level monitoring
  - Light level tracking
- **Security**:
  - Tamper detection alerts
  - Motion-triggered notifications
  - Sound threshold alerts
- **Integration**: 
  - Home Assistant compatible
  - MQTT-based communication
  - JSON payload format
